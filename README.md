This is my project programmable drum sequencer app.  This will
playback the user created rhythmic patterns the user  and will allow the
user to save these patterns to be recalled whenever a user is signed in.

My first thoughts about a web-based sequencer date back to before I became a
developer.  When practicing on a guitar, I wished I was able to access a drum
machine through my computer on the fly to program or load up drum beats to practice
along to.  Using actual recording or playback software usually requires a user
to close all other programs, or the program uses too many system resources to
be able to do anything else on the computer simultaneously. Also, a user's audio
program will usually be dedicated to a particular computer, so a user would be
unable to create these drum beats on any other computer.
Online metronomes are available, but the sound quality is usually poor.
I believe that this device would be welcome to any practicing musician with web
access who wants to create drum rhythm patterns quickly and easily.  I also think
that a broader audience of the public would enjoy this app for entertainment
purposes.
